In recent years, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) has become the reference standard for noninvasive evaluation of diffuse liver diseases, providing high accuracy for diagnosis, staging, and follow-up. One innovative application is MR elastography (MRE), which quantitatively assesses liver stiffness, crucial for identifying fibrosis stages. MRE has shown high sensitivity and specificity, making it a promising alternative to liver biopsy. Additionally, MRI techniques like diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and proton density fat fraction (PDFF) are being utilized to evaluate liver fat and fibrosis. These advancements highlight the growing importance of MRI in the management of liver diseases, offering noninvasive, accurate assessments that can replace traditional biopsy methods.
