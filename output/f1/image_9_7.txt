MRE is an imaging technique used to quantitatively evaluate the mechanical characteristics of the liver based on the propagation of mechanical waves through the liver tissue. MRE is among the most accurate noninvasive methods for detecting and staging liver fibrosis and could probably replace liver biopsy in the future clinical setting. The shear wave generated during the examination has a propagating velocity in the tissue which is directly proportional to the level of stiffness. Normal stiffness liver values are considered lower than 2.5 kPa. 

MRE can be performed both on 1.5 T or 3 T with dedicated hardware to propagate mechanical waves and specific software for processing images. To achieve its high reliability, this technique requires specific technical measures. Images for MRE are typically obtained with the patient in supine position, with a passive pneumatic driver, connected to an active pneumatic mechanical wave driver, that is positioned over the right lower chest wall in order to acquire the more hepatic tissue possible. 

A continuous acoustic vibration is then generated and transmitted to the liver via the passive driver. The mechanical waves used in MRE are typically in the acoustic frequency range of 40-150 Hz. In literature, studies are prevalently performed with continuous vibrations at 50 Hz, 60Hz, or 80Hz. 

MRE has shown in recent literature a high positive predictive value for ruling in moderate-significant fibrosis and a high negative predictive value for ruling out cirrhosis and staging fibrosis. Future directions for MRE include the characterization of focal lesions and the differentiation between liver stiffness caused by fibrosis, edema, inflammation, passive congestion, to assess precocious liver manifestations in context of alcohol consumption or in diabetes, to screen drugs mediated liver damages, or in monitoring the response in locoregional treatments for hepatocellular carcinoma.
