In the context of the images, the following relevant text can be extracted:

1. "MRE is among the most accurate noninvasive methods for detecting and staging liver fibrosis."
2. "The shear wave generated during the examination has a propagating velocity in the tissue which is directly proportional to the level of stiffness."
3. "MRE can be performed both on 1.5 T or 3 T with a dedicated hardware to propagate mechanical waves."
4. "A prospective study on 58 patients demonstrated an optimal agreement in measuring liver stiffness between 2D GRE and 2D SE-EPI."
5. "MRE has shown in recent literature a high PPV for ruling in moderate-significant fibrosis and a high NPV for ruling out cirrhosis and staging fibrosis."
6. "In addition, liver stiffness was significantly correlated with inflammation grade and fibrosis stage."

These sentences provide a concise overview of the significance and application of MRE in assessing liver conditions.
