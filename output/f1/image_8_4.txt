Technical aspects of performing MRE include the use of an active pneumatic driver to generate mechanical waves, which are transmitted to the liver via a passive driver positioned over the right lower chest wall. The image post-processing involves extracting qualitative color stiffness maps and generating quantitative liver stiffness measurements in kilopascals (kPa). Normal liver stiffness values are considered lower than 2.5 kPa. MRE is among the most accurate noninvasive methods for detecting and staging liver fibrosis, with studies showing high sensitivity and specificity for differentiating between fibrosis stages.
