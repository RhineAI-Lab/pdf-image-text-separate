Fat fraction MRI images of a 65-year old male patient with NAFLD. MRI-PDFF provides a quantitative assessment of hepatic fat throughout the liver by exploiting the resonance difference between the proton frequencies in water and fat. It works by separating the fat signal from the water signal, acquiring the gradient echo at specific echo times, and calculating the percentage of the combined signal that comes from the fat. MRI-PDFF is able to map the amount of fat of the entire liver and can be applied on any clinical magnetic resonance platform.
