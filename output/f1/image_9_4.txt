In recent years, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) has become a reference standard for the noninvasive evaluation of diffuse liver diseases, providing high accuracy for diagnosis, staging, and follow-up. Among the innovative applications of MRI, MR elastography (MRE) is particularly noteworthy, as it can identify fibrosis stages with high sensitivity and specificity. MRE measures liver stiffness, which is directly proportional to the level of fibrosis. 

The technique involves generating mechanical waves that propagate through liver tissue, allowing for quantitative assessment. Normal liver stiffness values are considered to be lower than 2.5 kPa. MRE has shown excellent performance in differentiating between various stages of liver fibrosis, with studies indicating its accuracy in predicting advanced fibrosis in conditions like nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and chronic hepatitis.

Additionally, MRE can be performed on different MRI systems, and it does not require contrast medium injection, making it a patient-friendly option. However, limitations exist, particularly in patients with significant iron overload, which can affect the quality of the elastography results. Future research aims to standardize the use of MRI techniques in clinical practice for patients with diffuse liver diseases, enhancing noninvasive diagnostic capabilities.
