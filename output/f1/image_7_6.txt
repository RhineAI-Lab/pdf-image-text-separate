MR elastography is an imaging technique used to quantitatively evaluate the mechanical characteristics of the liver based on the propagation of mechanical waves through the liver tissue. MRE is among the most accurate noninvasive methods for detecting and staging liver fibrosis. The shear wave generated during the examination has a propagating velocity in the tissue which is directly proportional to the level of stiffness. Normal stiffness liver values are considered lower than 2.5 kPa. MRE can be performed both on 1.5 T or 3 T with dedicated hardware to propagate mechanical waves and specific software for processing images. 

In a prospective study, Chen et al. found that in patients with NAFLD developing nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) without progression to fibrosis, liver stiffness was much higher than in those with simple steatosis. MRE is considered a highly accurate method for differentiating NASH from steatosis. 

MRE has shown in recent literature a high positive predictive value for ruling in moderate-significant fibrosis and a high negative predictive value for ruling out cirrhosis and staging fibrosis. Future directions for MRE include the characterization of focal lesions and the differentiation between liver stiffness caused by fibrosis, edema, inflammation, and passive congestion.
