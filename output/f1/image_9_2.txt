2. "The shear wave generated during the examination has a propagating velocity in the tissue which is directly proportional to the level of stiffness."
3. "MRE can be performed both on 1.5 T or 3 T with dedicated hardware to propagate mechanical waves."
4. "A continuous acoustic vibration is then generated and transmitted to the liver via the passive driver."
5. "MRE has shown in recent literature a high PPV for ruling in moderate-significant fibrosis and a high NPV for ruling out cirrhosis and staging fibrosis."
6. "In addition, liver stiffness was significantly correlated with inflammation grade and fibrosis stage."
