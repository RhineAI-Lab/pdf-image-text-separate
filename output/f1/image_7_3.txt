Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is becoming the reference standard of noninvasive evaluation of diffuse liver diseases because it is the only technique that has been considered to have great accuracy for the diagnosis, staging, and follow-up of these conditions. One of the most innovative MRI applications is represented by MR elastography (MRE) that is able to identify fibrosis stage ≥ 2 (F2-4) and stage ≥ 3 (F2-4), with a combination of high sensitivity (91%) and specificity (96%). 

MRE is an imaging technique used to quantitatively evaluate the mechanical characteristics of the liver based on the propagation of mechanical waves through the liver tissue. The shear wave generated during the examination has a propagating velocity in the tissue which is directly proportional to the level of stiffness. Normal stiffness liver values are considered lower than 2.5 kPa. 

MRE can be performed both on 1.5 T or 3 T with dedicated hardware to propagate mechanical waves and specific software for processing images. To achieve its high reliability, this technique requires specific technical measures. Images for MRE are typically obtained with the patient in supine position, with a passive pneumatic driver, connected to an active pneumatic mechanical wave driver, that is positioned over the right lower chest wall. 

In addition, MRE has shown in recent literature a high positive predictive value for ruling in moderate-significant fibrosis and a high negative predictive value for ruling out cirrhosis and staging fibrosis. Future directions for MRE include the characterization of focal lesions and the differentiation between liver stiffness caused by fibrosis, edema, inflammation, and passive congestion.
